# Unity Docs Rewrite (WIP)

This repository is home to a work-in-progress passion project which aims to rewrite the entirety of the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) from scratch in a style which closely resembles and pays homage to [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/).

## Why?
Many people find the existing Unity documentation to be lackluster with poorly written summaries, giving virtually no attention to the declaration of types and members nor the assemblies and namespaces in which they're defined.

MSDN is considered by many to be a prime example of documentation done right. With this project, it is aspired that Unity developers will be able to find consistency and reliability in better-written and better-structured documentation.
